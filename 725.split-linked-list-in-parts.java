 *
 * Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split
 * the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts".
 * 
 * The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should
 * have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being
 * null.
 * 
 * The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts
 * occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts
 * occurring later.
 * 
 * Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are
 * formed.
 * 
 * 
 * Examples
 * 1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts
 * [ [1], 
 * [2],
 * [3],
 * [4],
 * null ]
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
 * Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
 * Explanation:
 * The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
 * For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2,
 * \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
 * The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
 * The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a
 * ListNode is [].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
 * Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
 * Explanation:
 * The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most
 * 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The length of root will be in the range [0, 1000].
 * Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range [0, 999].
 * k will be an integer in the range [1, 50].
